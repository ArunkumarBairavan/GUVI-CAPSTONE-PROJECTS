 The following project is about analyzing the sentiments of tweets on social networking website
 ‘Twitter’. The dataset for this project is scraped from Twitter. It contains 1,600,000 tweets
 extracted using Twitter API. It is a labeled dataset with tweets annotated with the sentiment (0 =
 negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive).

 1. target: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
 2. ids: The id of the tweet .
 3. date: The date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
 4. flag: The query. If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
